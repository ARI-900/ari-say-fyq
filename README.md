# 🏥 AI-Powered Health Recommendation System

An AI-based system that predicts possible health conditions based on patient-provided symptoms and suggests preventive measures or next steps.  

Developed as a **Final Year Project** by **Sayan, Arijit, Debaroti, and Joymalya**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Health Recommendation System** is designed to help individuals make informed decisions about their health by analyzing symptoms and providing relevant recommendations.

This system leverages **Machine Learning** to process patient data and generate possible health risks, along with advice for seeking professional medical help.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is for **educational purposes only** and should not replace professional medical diagnosis.
